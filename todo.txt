+framework to drive everything
+convert json to model
+analyze the generated api
+library to generate dart source (bin/generate_dart.dart)
-parse idl
-write model
-convert idl to model
-support side-car source code, and generator overrides
-test the generated api
-it's likely that we'll have to create a model for the generated dart code. so,
 idl  ==> idl model ==> dart model ==> dart code
 json ==> idl model ==> dart model ==> dart code

-have a script which can parse and diff meta.apis.json and this page:
http://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index.html
-or find the metadata the chrome team uses to build the API documentation?
